# Hypotheses and Methods
   
In this chapter, I introduce a series of questions resulting from the literature review of Chapter 1, which I will use to formulate hypotheses. I will then operationalize these hypotheses, and attempt to predict analytical outcomes based on the theories of Chapter 1. Following these hypotheses, I will outline key methods I will use to test them.
   
## Hypotheses
  
### Questions
  
Before moving in to outlining hypotheses, the first step necessary is to frame a series of questions, which the hypotheses will flow from. Based on relevant research, the most obvious first question to ask would be:

$$Q1: What~is~the~effect~of~mail~voting~on~turnout? $$
  
I went through this question substantially in the previous chapter; it should be clear that depending on which paradigm of participation choice is present, the answer here can be radically different.   
   
In order to best answer the previous question, it is necessary to establish some conditions on importance of effect. Therefore it is also necessary to ask the following two questions:   
   
$$Q2: Is ~this~ effect~ significant ~when~ compared~ to ~other~ metrics~ that~ affect~ turnout?$$
$$Q3: Is ~this~ effect ~consistent~ over~ time?$$
   
The last question asked in this thesis is more specific to a particular formulation of Aldritch's hypothesis on voting "at the margins". I mentioned in the previous section that VBM could be theorized to have a more significant effect
