# Hypotheses and Methods
   
In this chapter, I introduce a series of questions resulting from the literature review of Chapter 1, which I will use to formulate hypotheses. I will then operationalize these hypotheses, and attempt to predict analytical outcomes based on the theories of Chapter 1. Following is a brief introduction to the State of Colorado--on which I apply my hypotheses--and an outline of the data used for this thesis, including sourcing, a brief description, and wrangling. After that I shall discuss the methodological approaches used to test my hypotheses, starting with Exploratory Data Analysis and continuing with a series of statistical models, whose choice and parametrization I will discuss in depth.
