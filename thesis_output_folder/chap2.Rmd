# Hypotheses and Methods
   
In this chapter, I introduce a series of questions resulting from the literature review of Chapter 1, which I will use to formulate hypotheses. I will then operationalize these hypotheses, and attempt to predict analytical outcomes based on the theories of Chapter 1. Following these hypotheses, I will outline key methods I will use to test them.
