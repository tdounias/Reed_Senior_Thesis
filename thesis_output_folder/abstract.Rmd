Mail voting in the United States has always existed to some degree, for absentee or overseas voters. Starting with Oregon in 1996, several states have implimented mail voting more generally, making it available to all individuals for general, midterm, primary, or local elections. In 2013, Colorado implemented the latest in a series of in-state election reforms, ensuring that every Coloradoan receives a mail ballot for every election. This thesis aims at following a series of studies that conduct quantitative assesments of the impact of mail voting on voter turnout by examining Colorado voter registration files, and describing, fitting, and interpreting multilevel general additive regression models. In terms of my hypotheses, I conclude that there is evidence of a positive effect of mail voting on national elections, but that this evidence is weak and present only in my county level models. Through this process, I also contribute to the literature by presenting a description of modeling and data wrangling difficulties associated with voter registration files, and giving a series of potential solutions, as well as an extensive coding library to aid future research on the subject.
