Mail voting in the United States was conceived and first implemented to serve absentee voters during the Civil War [@fortier_absentee_2006] and has persisted until the present day, becoming one of the key reforms associated with "convenience voting" and the expansion of the democratic franchise [@gronke_convenience_2008]. In 2013, Colorado implemented the latest in a series of in-state election reforms and became the third state in the nation with universal mail voting for all elections, after Oregon and Washington. Despite claims by policymakers that mail voting should have a strong, positive effect on voter turnout, a recent series of studies on Oregon, Washington, parts of California, and Colorado have failed to show consistent results, disagreeing both on the scale and the direction (positive or negative) that this effect has. This thesis aims at following this series of studies by examining Colorado voter registration files for recent elections (2010-2016). These files consist of a registration file with voter information and a history file with voter participation data in Colorado elections, and provide all information necessary for a comprehensive study of turnout. By describing, fitting, and interpreting multilevel general additive regression models of voter turnout based on these data, I show that there is a small positive effect of mail voting on turnout in national elections at the county level. This thesis also contributes to the literature by presenting a description of modeling and data wrangling difficulties associated with voter registration files, and giving a series of potential solutions, as well as an extensive coding library to aid future research on the subject.
