# The State of the Literature {#rmd-basics}
  
I begin my thesis with an examination of turnout: what it is, its use as a metric of participation, and how it is estimated. I continue by presenting a comprehensive list of current theories on voter decision and participation; these offer conflicting descriptions as to what variables are important when trying to predict the turnout effects of elections policy. I then provide a run-down of current voting methods in the US, with a particular focus on mail voting. I make a series of predictions on what the expected effect of mail voting on turnout is, based on each of the aforementioned theories. I end on a presentation of past studies that have tried to statistically estimate this effect.   
  
The most basic form of regression is $y\sim x$, where $y$ is the response and $x$ is the predictor. By the end of this chapter, I aim to clarify the theoretical framework behind turnout (response), mail voting (main predictor), and the predicted correlation between the two (value of regression coefficients). 

## Turnout and Political Participation  

In their seminal work *Participation in America*, Verba and Nie divide the modes of political participation into electoral activity (voting or campaigning), and non-electoral activity (cooperative activity or citizen-initiated contact of political operatives). As Verba and Nie point out, of these forms of participation voting is the most widespread and regularized. All voting-eligible citizens are given specific instructions on how to vote, where to do so, and at what time. Verba and Nie refer to voting as a "high pressure" concern for elected officials, since their continued service in their positions is directly dependent on this form of participation. They do, however, point out that voting does not convey as much information to government actors as other forms of participation; interest groups and direct contact are significantly more targeted. The conclusion they draw is that while voting may not be the most specific of ways to participate, but it is the most measurable, uniform, and general indicator of political engagement[@verba_participation_1972].  
  
In subsequent portions of their book they use two measures of voting: turnout and frequency[@verba_participation_1972]. Frequency refers to the proportion of elections that a particular voter participated in over the total amount of elections they were eligible to vote in. Turnout is the ratio of ballots cast over a measure of the voting population, as in the following equation:  
$$ \% ~Turnout = \frac{Total~Ballots~Cast}{Measure~of~Voting~Population}\times100\%$$  
In this thesis, I will use turnout as a measure of electoral political participation. I make this choice for three reasons: first, there is substantial literature on the relationship between mail voting (the subject of my study) and turnout; second, there is also substantial literature behind the choice that individuals make between turning out to vote and not participating, meaning that I have a strong theoretical background from which to build hypotheses; third, the data I have available includes complete individual electoral history, making calculating turnout possible.

### Calculating Turnout

There are two issues to consider when calculating the numerator for turnout. In any given election, there can be several candidates and issues on the ballot, ranging from US Senate races to local school-board contests. Therefore a first issue is "undervoting", or only completing some parts of a ballot and not voting in every contest[@saltman_history_2009]. This means that there can be different turnout counts produced by electoral contest for any given election date: one for US Senate, one per state legislative contest, etc. Alternatively, turnout can be calculated for that election day, and not for any particular race; here the numerator is every ballot cast. I use this second conception of turnout, calculating at the election level. A second issue is that a fair amount of voters may turn out (by physically going to a polling place or mailing their ballot), but have their ballot rejected for registration issues, concern for authenticity, or a range of other complications. Since these voters did take action to participate, should a metric of turnout as political participation include them? I would tend to answer yes, but the data I have available do not include information on voters having their ballots rejected; this means that my final calculations only include participants whose ballots were officially counted. 

The three main statistics used for the denominator are the total voting age population (VAP), voting eligible population (VEP), and the number of registered voters in a certain geographical location. The total voting age population (all individuals over 18 years of age) can be measured using data from the US Census. However, such an interpretation of VAP counts individuals of age that are not allowed to vote, like people with severe mental illnesses or felons, and does not count oversees voters or military personnel. Michael McDonald offers an alternative to VAP he calls "voting eligible population", which corrects for such individuals [@mcdonald_true_2007]. 

Counts of registered voters are also a useful tool for calculating turnout, as they usually require no estimation. These counts can simply be extracted from voter registration files. Such a metric is only representative of the electoral political participation level of a group that has already taken a step towards participating, by registering to vote. Researchers should be careful to also include registration level by income, race, gender, or other metrics if using this form of turnout calculation to infer levels of participation by social or demographic characteristics.

The punch line here is that calculation of turnout is not an obvious choice, and will have an impact on what conclusions are drawn. To give one example, consider Oregon's Motor Voter program, that automatically registers voters when they interact with the DMV. It is conceivable that this reform will _decrease_ turnout when measured as a percentage of the total registered voter count, but _increase_ turnout when measured against total population. This happens if more people register to vote, but do not actually do so--in other words, both number of registrants and number of ballots cast are increasing, but the former increases at a larger rate than the latter. In my thesis I will use registered voter counts as the turnout denominator.

### Turnout and Voting Probability Models

Statistical models of turnout can be constructed at either the individual or group level. At the individual level, a model is built to predict the probability of voting for every member of a group, which then can sum over the members to create an estimate for turnout. This is a classification problem that can be solved with models such as Probit or Logit generalized linear regressions. Turnout can be calculated for several groups: counties, precincts, racial characteristics, etc. The unit of observation is a single group, and a regression model is fit on turnout as a continuous variable. In this thesis, I estimate models both at the county and the individual level.

All of these models include a standard set of societal variables at the individual and/or group level, administrative variables (whether the district uses Postal Voting, whether Voter ID requirements are particularly strict), election-specific variables (closeness of election or campaign expenditure) and sometimes time-series data like previous levels of turnout. This type of analysis is used either to predict turnout or draw inferences on the effects that certain explanatory variables have on electoral participation.  

Meta-analyses conducted by Geys (2006), Geys and Cancela (2016), and Smets (2013) provide a clearer picture on which predictors are relevant to turnout. Geys includes 83 studies of national US elections in his initial meta-analysis [@geys_explaining_2006], later increasing that number to 185 (Geys and Cancela, 2016) and adding local elections. On aggregate-level models for national elections they conclude that competitiveness, campaign financing, and registration policy have the most pronounced effects, while on the sub-national level there are more pronounced effects for societal variables and characteristics of election administration (spending, voting policy, etc.). Smets and Van Ham (2013) examine individual-level predictors for turnout in a similar meta-analysis, and conclude that "age and age squared, education, residential mobility, region, media exposure, mobilization (partisan and nonpartisan), vote in previous election, party identification, political interest, and political knowledge" [@smets_embarrassment_2013] are the most significant explanatory variables for turnout, along with income and race. I will specify the model I will use for turnout in the second chapter.

### Deciding to Vote

Here I take one step back from turnout, and examine the theories surrounding individual choices to vote or abstain. There are four main theories outlined in the literature on why individuals chose to vote:

* *Decision "at the margins"*: In his 1993 study, Aldrich posits that voting is a low cost/low benefit behavior. Voting is a decision that individuals make "at the margins"; in most people, the urge to vote is not overwhelmingly strong, so individuals will vote when it is convenient to them, when they are motivated by a competitive race, when policies are put in place to help them, or when they are subjected to GOTV (Get-Out-the-Vote) efforts. For Aldrich, this is corroborated by the fact that most turnout models present consistent, yet weak, relational variables: if decisions are made "at the margins", then no single predictor would have an overwhelming effect. This is also supported by Matsusaka (1997), and Burden & Neiheisel (2012). Matsusaka expresses support for a more "random" process of voting, where turnout models are ambiguous because of the difficulty that predicting "at the margins" entails [@matsusaka_voter_1999].  Burden & Neiheisel (2012) use data from Wisconsin  to calculate a net _negative_ effect of 2% on turnout following the expansion of early voting access in the state. While this can be read as an Aldrich effect on turnout, the authors claim that their findings should be attributed to a lack of "election-day effects"[@aldrich_rational_1993; @neiheisel_impact_2012].

* *Habitual Voting*: While Aldrich supports that there is no single overwhelming predictor of turnout, Fowler (2006) posits that future voting behavior can be strongly predicted using individual voting history. This leads to the conclusion that individuals are set to either be habitual voters, or habitual non-voters [@plutzer_becoming_2002] by their upbringing and social circumstances, locking them into distinct groups [@fowler_habitual_2006].  

* *Social/Structural Voting*: Social and structural voting presents several common characteristics with Habitual Voting, but includes the claim that the decision to vote or not is deeply rooted in socioeconomic factors. This in turn is interpreted to mean that the divide between traditionally voting and non-voting groups can only be bridged by directly dealing with the socioeconomic divide between them [@edlin_voting_2007 ;@berinsky_perverse_2005].

* *Resources and Organization*: To some extent growing from structural theories of voting, resources and organizations theory emphasizes the interaction of personal political and societal characteristics of voters, and actions taken by politicians to mobilize participation. This theory is very broad in the inputs it assesses for voter participation, ranging from practical issues of access and resources (how easy it is for someone to vote if they so choose), to public policy feedback effects and signaling (how the government's policies affect the people and how they react), to how political parties and groups choose to mobilize and approach voters [@rosenstone_mobilization_2003]. Apart from Rosenstone and Hansen's work (2013), there have been several studies examining voter participation based on resources and organizations theory, a lot of which come from the public policy side of political science. Some examples are Chen's study of how distributive benefits like federal emergency aid affect participation among recipients, after controlling for partisan characteristics (2012), or Mettler and Stonecash's examination of correlation between welfare program participation and political mobilization (2008), or Campbell's analysis of social security recipients and their voting patterns (2002). The punchline in all these studies is that public policy is correlated with trends in participation, either because recipients of benefits wish to protect such programs, or because of the interaction between partisanship and government support, or because of access related to resources and voting laws [@mettler_government_2008; @chen_voter_2013; @campbell_self-interest_2002].  


##From Theory to Policy

###Voting Methods
  
I have already flagged in my introduction the reason why theories behind voting choice matter: each construct an image of the electorate that reacts differently to policy change around voting. They are all an answer to the fact that elections policy is not value neutral, but has implications for turnout, which in turn has implications for the franchise of democracy.   

In trying to respond to the issues set up by theoretical paradigms, different states--both in the global and US contexts--have adapted to different ways of conducting elections.  In the US, voting styles can be simplified into three categories:  

* *In-Person Election Day*, for which all individuals are required to vote at a polling place on election day. Standard accommodations for overseas or excused absentee voters apply, but the vast majority of people will have to be present to vote in a particular time frame.  

* *In-Person Early Voting*, for which all individuals must vote in person at a polling place, but the timeframe for voting extends for around two weeks and not a single day.

* *Mail Voting*, for which individuals have a no-excuse-necessary^[Individuals do not need to present proof that they will be out of state or unable to physically be present at a polling place, but can just ask to be mailed their ballot.] option for not being present when they vote, or for filling in a mailed ballot and dropping it off at designated locations.

Note that some form of voting via mail ballot exists in all three cases; the distinction between Mail Voting and the other two is that there is no excuse necessary to cast a mail ballot. In such systems mail voting is not an exception, but exists as something between a common practice and a universal means of casting a ballot^[It is also commonly argued that full postal voting is a 4th category in and of itself. I don't make this distinction here, but in the following section I break down Mail Voting into different categories, one of which is full postal voting.].

In-person election day voting is, historically speaking, the way the vast majority of democracies have conducted their elections. Therefore it has been of interest for researchers to examine if other systems can outperform that baseline for some metric of participation. Specifically, it is most interesting to examine voting styles that are heralded for their expansion of turnout, to see whether popular beliefs on their benefits and drawbacks hold: are such policies different from the base model of conducting American elections? Do they present new challenges and unique selling points? In this context, mail voting is particularly interesting because it is quickly becoming a trend in state-level elections administration.
  
### What is VBM?  

Vote-By-Mail (or as it is commonly referred to by most in the field, VBM) is a process by which voters receive a ballot delivered by mail to their homes. Voters then have a variety of options on how to return their ballot, ranging from dropping it off at a pre-designated location, to mailing it in, to bringing it to a polling place. The two first options are most commonly implemented, with a very small number of states still operating polling places for mail ballots. This varies across states that have implemented VBM. Some common forms of the VBM policy are:  

* *Postal Voting*: All-Mail elections. All voters receive a ballot by mail, which can then be returned to a pre-designated location or mailed in to be counted. All-mail elections currently occur in Oregon, Washington, and Colorado.

* *No-Excuse Absentee*: Voters can choose to register as absentee voters without giving any reason related to disability, health, distance to polling place etc. This is the case in 27 states and the District of Columbia.

* *Permanent No-Excuse Absentee*: This is similar to the previous system, but allows voters to register as absentees indefinitely, without having to renew their registration each year; they become de facto all-mail voters. This is in place in a very large number of the no-excuse absentee voting states like Utah, California, Montana, Arizona, New Jersey, and others.

* *Hybrid Systems*: In hybrid systems, voters receive a mail ballot but can choose to disregard it and vote conventionally. This is the case in Colorado. In other states postal voting is not mandatory for all counties, as some are still allowed to conduct their elections conventionally; these states keep an in-person option open as a part of their elections administration system. This is the case in California, Utah, and Montana.  
  
Vote-By-Mail is also commonly considered a type of early voting, since voters receive their ballots around two weeks in advance of election day; they are also able to return that ballot whenever they wish within that time-frame. This means that Vote-By-Mail can be counted as a "convenience voting" reform [@gronke_convenience_2008]. These are usually implemented by state and local governments with the argument that they either expand the democratic franchise by bringing in new voters, or by making it more likely that current registered voters participate in the electoral process [@national_council_of_state_legislatures_absentee_2018].

### How Theories Apply to VBM  
  
Under Aldrich's paradigm, vote by mail would not effect significant change in voting behavior. The whole concept of a decision "at the margins" is that the forces at play when an individual decides to vote are overwhelmingly strong both ways, so any effect that policy can have will minimaly shift these margins. In a presidential election, for example, the forces at play include the media, national committees, social effects etc. In this environment, some added convenience does not significantly add to an individual's decision to turn out. However, this would indicate that at a local level, where national and media effects are less strong, the effect of VBM on turnout might be more significant. The effect would be present for all groups, not only those currently registered, since voting would be easier uniformly.   

If we asume habitual voting, the conclusion on VBM would differ significantly. In this case, the effect to be considered is how VBM impacts already formed habits around voting. It could be argued that VBM has no effect, which follows if we assume that voting habits formed do not shift if the mode of voting changes. It could also be argued that VBM might have a negative effect on turnout in the short term, because it disrupts the habit of election day, before people adapt to th enew policy context and settle into new groups of habitual voters and non-voters.

Under social and structural voting contexts, VBM retains rather than stimulates new voters [@berinsky_perverse_2005]. This means that already registered and semi-active voters are more likely to participate, but there is no significant change in the amount of new voters entering the franchise. This would mean that traditional forms of voting policy that emphasize access to the polls will do nothing to bring in disenfranchised people, and potentially hide the problem under an inflated turnout statistic calculated on registered voters. Berinsky in particular emphasizes the need for a shift towards voter education, rather than early voting or VBM policies [@berinsky_making_2016].

Vote-by-Mail is obviously not a welfare or spending program, but it does increase individual resources in terms of voting capacity. Filling out a ballot at your kitchen table does not include spending time to go to a polling center, or standing in line to vote, or factoring in significant changes to your daily schedule for election day. A mail ballot can usually be dropped off at several locations, or can be mailed in along with any other mail a voter may have to send. Less time and effort is spent on casting your vote. This in turn has both a practical effect (building capacity) and a more behavioral effect such as a feeling of inclusion, ot an interaction with the process of voting that comes through a ballot at your doorstep. This effect would not exist if you had chosen not to go to a polling place [@schneider_behavioral_1990]. Under a resources and organizations framework, such practical and behavioural effects would lead to increased political participation and as such would predict a strong, positive effect of VBM on turnout. 

### General Results on VBM 
   
I will start with studies that show a negative effect on turnout. Bergman (2011) uses a series of logistic regression models of individual voting probability in California, during a period where only some parts of the state conducted VBM elections. This is called a natural experiment, and it is common throughout the literature. Bergman's results show a statistically significant drop in voting probability in VBM counties [@bergman_changing_2011]. Using a similar method, Keele (2018) takes a single city in Colorado (Basalt City) which is divided into two different voting districts which impliment different voting systems. The conclusion is, again, a 2-4% drop in turnout along the VBM part of the city [@keele_geographic_2017]. Burden et al. (2014) take a different approach, using country-wide election data from 2004 and 2008 presidential elections, and compares districts based on early voting practices. Their results show a significant drop in turnout, which can be associated to VBM as well due to its closeness to EV [@burden_election_2014].  

In contrast, Gerber et al. (2013), applying both individual and county-level models for the state of Washington, reach the conclusion that VBM increases turnout by around 2-4%; they use the same natural experiment model that offers itself to researchers in states that are under transitional systems [@gerber_identifying_2013]. R.M. Stein also reaches a similar conclusion when examining Colorado's practice of "vote centers", which are non-precinct attached polling places servicing multiple counties [@stein_engaging_2008]. I include this paper here due to the link that voting centers have with VBM, as they serve as drop-off points for mail-in ballots. Richey (2008) examines the effects that Oregon's VBM program has on turnout by using past elections data, concluding a 10% positive trend associated with the policy [@richey_sean_voting_2008]. This effect is studied again by Gronke et al.(2012) who find a similar positive effect with much lower magnitude, which might point to a novelty effect: the existence of diminishing returns in turnout after the implementation of this policy [@gronke_voting_2012]. Gronke et al. (2017), again studying Oregon but focusing on Oregon's Motor Voter program, find evidence of positive association to turnout. I include these effects due to Oregon being an exclusively VBM state, and because this paper uses a "synthetic control group" model, a particularly interesting statistical technique[@griffin_who_2017]. Lastly, a study conducted by Pantheon Analytics on Colorado, which compares actual turnout to predicted levels for VBM counties in Colorado. The results show a positive effect of approximately 3.3% due to VBM [@edelman_letting_2018].

The conclusion to be drawn is that results on VBM vary significantly. There are multiple studies, using multiple methods, on multiple states, with multiple results. This only adds to the importance of being careful when constructing models and hypotheses to test VBM's effects on turnout, as assumptions made in the process can critically impact the results.
