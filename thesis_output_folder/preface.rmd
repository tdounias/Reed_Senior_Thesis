I started my second attempt at this preface by reading through my maternal grandfather's eulogy. In my bloodline I have researchers, engineers, teachers, social scientists, and literary scholars, all with astoundingly different approaches to stemming their curiosity about the world around them. All of them, though, have in common that they have fought long and hard for me to have what I do now, in my privilege to study at Reed College and live a financially secure life, but also in my ability to determine my future in a democratic state. They all fought for Greece to be as free as it is today, even though our elections may often deliver painful results. I find it very fitting that the way I honor their legacy is by studying the system that they helped create^[And by also veering wildly away from any of their own previous research interests, much to the occasional chagrin of my close relatives, and much in the same fashion that they seem to have steered clear of their own parents.].
\par
Of course, my object of study is not Greek, but American elections. I made this choice first by necessity, since the data access and previous literature is exponentially greater. I soon realized, however, that the puzzles that US elections present are both generalizable and deeply intriguing. I was taken in by the complexity of translating the will of the people for the world's greatest economic and military power into political action and by how the most initially mundane policy choices could have massive impacts on representation. As I mention again in my introduction, democracies are based on procedures as much as principles, and I am now very happy to have completed my first pass at adding to the scientific knowledge available for one such procedure.

Here I must mention my first thesis adviser, and in fact my academic adviser and guide throughout my years at Reed, Professor Paul Gronke. Paul as a person transmits emphatic dedication and love to the subject of his research, to the extent that it is hard not to be taken along for the ride. He helped me get back my sense of direction that I had lost before transferring to Reed, he was the first to suggest I do an interdisciplinary thesis, and he stuck with me and worked incredibly hard to guide me through the process. While at times not giving me the answer I wanted to hear, he also helped ground me and calm me down when my own sense of anxiety was getting the better of me, and I can't thank him enough for putting up with that as well.
\par
I am, of course, an interdisciplinary major. This is partly by virtue of the academic credits I gained from accidentally trying to be an engineer for two years after graduating high school, but mostly because of the people who have taught me mathematics. My mathematical education was always deeply grounded in applicability and the elegance of statistically approximating real-world phenomena. At Reed College I met my second adviser, Andrew Bray, whose calm and deeply sincere admiration for statistical applications is infectious. Andrew often pushed me to accomplish tasks that I felt were beyond my capacity, but despite my protests I always managed to get done with his help. Because of him I feel that I not only know how to apply the methods I use, but that I really *understand* them (or at least understand how much I *do not* understand). He has worked incredibly hard, sacrificing time from his sabbatical to oversee my senior thesis, and I cannot thank him enough.
\par
I would like to thank Andrew Menger, Judd Choate, and Robert Stein. Andrew Menger, Postdoctoral Fellow at the Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy at Washington University, was gracious enough to share the data that he and his team collected and are currently working on; he saved my thesis by giving me access to voter files from 2012-2016, while I only had access to the 2017 file. Without his help, I would not have been able to complete my analysis. Judd Choate, Director of Elections for Colorado was instrumental in helping me procure data for 2017, from which I started my thesis. He also helped me troubleshoot data issues by connecting me with his team. Robert Stein, Lena Goldman Fox Professor of Political Science at Rice University, also gave me guidance when I ran into data problems common in his field.
\par
I would like to also show my appreciation to the Reed College Computer User Services that loaned me the computer I am using to run my models, and saving me what I can safely assume to be several months worth of listening to my own laptop's fans screaming for mercy while I age, considerably. Paul Manson and my fellow Reedie Jay Lee were also helpful in solving issues with presentation, mapping, tables, and the R Markdown thesis template. The template itself was coded by Chester Ismay. I thank all of them.
\par
There are so many people at Reed and back home that have been important to me that I will almost certainly fail at  mentioning them all. Consider the following a woefully incomplete list. To GameDEV, my dorm, you eternally empathetic, thoughtful, and warm friends, with whom I lived out my Reed years in full force. There is not much to say other than that I will forever miss being part of your community, and I am proud of you all. To the Reed Mock Trial Team, who helped me procrastinate and escape campus with good company when I needed it most. You are all awesome and I am sure you will get to ORCS this year!
\par
To Kathy Saitas, who gave me a home away from home from my first week here. To all my Professors that took interest in me and helped me along the way. To Joanne Buzaglo and her family, that taught me to be a Philly sports fan and gave me a home for fall breaks. I thank all of you for your kindness.
\par
To my innumerable friends back home, I apologize for not having the space for all of you here. Suffice to say, if you ever played DotA with me while I was here, if we played soccer back home, or shared a beer, or sang, or discussed this year's Fantasy Premier League, then consider this as an expression of gratitude for being there for me. I miss you all.
\par
Last, but most importantly, my family: Theodoros, Eftychia, Julius, Poly, my uncle and aunt Christos and Christina, my cousin (now Dr.) Philip and my parents George and Marina. You have given me a life worth living, a home worth missing, and a world worth fighting for.
