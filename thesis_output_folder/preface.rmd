Coming to Reed College from the National Technical University of Athens--where I was pursuing an electrical and computer engineering degree--I tentatively declared my major interest as being Political Science, only to be instantly swept up by Professor Paul Gronke and enlisted in his ongoing campaign to conquer elections data. I developed into an interdisciplinary Mathematics and Political Science major, which also led me to gain the support of Professor Andrew Bray as my second thesis adviser. My topic here is mail voting, which is very close to Professor Gronke's scholarly interests; his enthusiasm is, to some extent infectious. This topic is of great interest to me because it involves the often overlooked administrative workings of democracy--the cogs which support the process of getting the people's will translated into action. This is of particular interest in Oregon politics as well, as our representatives and local officials are all strong proponents of VBM.

There seems to be a nationwide abundance of individuals that are committed to studying how the franchise of democracy measures the people's will, and I am eternally grateful to several of them for their help with procuring data, answering quantitative and qualitative questions, and enthusiastically engaging with me when we conversed directly.

I would also like to thank my advisers, Paul Gronke and Andrew Bray, who have put in an incredibly large amount of work for me. Paul Gronke was present and quickly gave solutions when my data seemed to be unfit for the conclusions I wished to draw; through this process he projected calm when I was not, and injected my work with a sense of pragmatism. Paul Gronke made me feel that my thesis would be completed and ready, even when I was doubting that fact myself. Andrew Bray, I thank especially for still working with me despite being on sabbatical this semester; he sacrificed a lot of his independent research time on my thesis of his own volition, and showed the same enthusiasm about statistical applications and questions that made him such a great instructor in class.

Reed College is hard, and I could not have completed my time here without so many different people supporting me. Although my space here is too limited to describe my gratitude, I will try giving a woefully incomplete list. (After my first draft)
