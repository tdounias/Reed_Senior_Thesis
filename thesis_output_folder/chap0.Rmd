# Introduction {.unnumbered}

The democratic system is based on procedures as much as principles. The way that democracies chose to tally the will of the people is always a messy, controversial process. Thus the design and implementation of voting systems is far from being neutral; the decisions made on who votes, and how, when, and where they do so is inherently coupled with the outcome. Underlying those decisions is a nebulous, inconclusively answered question: are elections fair, and how can we make them more so.
	
The passage of the Help America Vote Actâ€”or HAVA--[@robert_nay_help_2002], which mandated states to update and consolidate public voter registration files, and created the US Elections Assistance Commission that makes available county level data, innovated the way we use data based approaches to answer this question. Public voter files were initially used by private corporations like TargetSmart or Catalyst, which cleaned up the files for use by political campaigns trying to tailor their message as closely as possible to individual voters. Researchers quickly realized the massive potential that such data has, and started partnering with such firms or conduction independent cleaning and structuring of such data themselves. These data provided information at the individual level, with geocoding usually at the precinct level. This in turn meant that, though very complex as a task, it became possible to use such files along with census data at the block level to estimate individual characteristics like race, education, or income at incredible levels of accuracy. Even without the resources of a multi-million dollar private market, such methods along with voter files alowed researchers to make concrete inferences of individual characteristics [@hersh_hacking_2015]. Voting related theories derived from political science are now commonly tested using advanced statistical methods and huge amounts of data; both disciplines tackle these data to face joint problems such as quantifying the quality of voter registration files [@ansolabehere_quality_2010], or linking disparate voter records [@ansolabehere_adgn:_2017].
