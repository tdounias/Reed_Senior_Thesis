# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Elections shift the course of history in ways that are sometimes small, but often enormous. Particularly in the United States, but really in any democracy across the world, elections have the capacity to shape the existence of millions of people for decades to come. Elections are written in the history books, regardless of the final outcome. It is truly wondrous that this power is in *our* hands, that every seismic shift in the course of our states comes from the tremors each of us cause with our ballots. This is a power that people have suffered and continue to suffer for, a power my own parents and grandparents risked their lives for. The way we give people access to this power, the way nations like the United States or my birthplace of Greece choose to conduct their elections and the enfranchisement and disenfranchisement such choices may cause has never ceased to be contentious.  
  
What quickly becomes apparent, however, is that beyond the soaring rhetoric of democratic power, the setup of our elections systems is not straightforward in the slightest. Starting from the beginning, there is still no consensus on *who* gets to vote. Do felons get the vote? Florida (as of 2018) says yes, as does much of Europe, but other states in the US say no. How about permanent residents? Should people have to pass a basic political knowledge test to vote? Is one informed vote more important than a vote from someone who lacks knowledge of current affairs and government? Should people be forced to show ID when voting, to protect the franchise, or is this restrictive and undemocratic? *When* people get to vote is similarly contentious. Is early voting something we should support, or does it dilute the effect of election day turnout? Should voting day be a national holiday? How about refferenda? Should the people be directly consulted by their governments on seminal issues? Finally, there is the question of *how* or *where* people vote. How many polling places are enough? Should we use paper ballots or voting machines? Should people be automatically registered to vote? Should they be allowed to register on election day? Do we freeze registrations before election day, and if so how long before? Should we allow voting by mail? Permanent absentee status? All-mail elections? This is all even before making choices on subjects like the allocation of representatives by state or prefecture, or the total number of parliamentarians, or how many chambers congress should have.

The 2000 Presidential election between Al Gore and George W. Bush was famously decided in Florida by a razor thin margin of votes. Following the final result--which occured in the halls of the United States Supreme Court whose decision in *Bush v. Gore* halted all Florida recounts that were in progress--researchers claimed that the voting machines and ballot cards used were confusing and misleading, or that the results of a manual recount could have shifted the election. Many voters, for example, mistakenly voted for a different candidate because of the confusing layout of outdated punch-card voting machines. 22,000 voters in Duval County had their ballots rejected due to "overvoting", because they were given ballots telling them to vote on multiple pages for the same candidate: an action that would spoil their ballot[@saltman_history_2009].

A democratic system is based on procedures as much as principles. Elections are about translating the vote of the people into political power, government action, and fair representation by chosen representatives. It should by now be clear to the reader that the way we vote can often be critical to the outcome. Thus the design and implementation of voting systems is far from being neutral; the decisions made on who votes, and how, when, and where they do so often serves to alter the course of history. Underlying those decisions is a nebulous, inconclusively answered question: are elections fair, and how can we make them more so?

The purpose of research into such questions is to both to model and understand the behaviour of the participants, and to formulate an idea on what the optimal policy is. Research conclusions on their own obviously cannot sway policy; such decisions are made, fittingly, with the input of the people or their representatives through processes of policymaking whose study and function is beyond the scope of this thesis. In my thesis, I wish to focus on just one of the multitude of elections policies that are either discussed or enacted in the US at present: Vote By Mail. My purpose is to add to the existing literature of quantitative studies on how Vote By Mail affects voter turnout, and through this process draw conclusions on what behavioural model of voter choice best fits the reality of mail voting. 
	
The passage of the Help America Vote Actâ€”or HAVA--[@robert_nay_help_2002] innovated the way we use data based approaches to answer such question, by mandating states to update and consolidate public voter registration files, and creating the US Elections Assistance Commission that makes county level data available. Public voter files were initially used by private corporations like TargetSmart or Catalyst, which cleaned up the files for use by political campaigns trying to tailor their message as closely as possible to individual voters. Researchers quickly realized the massive potential that such data has, and started partnering with such firms or conducting independent cleaning and structuring of such data themselves. These data provided information at the individual level, with geocoding usually at the precinct level. This in turn meant that, though very complex as a task, it became possible to use such files along with census data at the block level to estimate individual characteristics like race, education, or income at incredible levels of accuracy. Even without the resources of a multi-million dollar private market, such methods along with voter files alowed researchers to make concrete inferences of individual characteristics [@hersh_hacking_2015]. Voting related theories derived from political science are now commonly tested using advanced statistical methods and huge amounts of data; both disciplines tackle these data to face joint problems such as quantifying the quality of voter registration files [@ansolabehere_quality_2010], or linking disparate voter records [@ansolabehere_adgn:_2017].
