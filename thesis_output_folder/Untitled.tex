  \chapter*{Introduction}\label{introduction}
  \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}
  
  The democratic system is based on procedures as much as principles. The
  way that democracies chose to tally the will of the people is always a
  messy, controversial process. Thus the design and implementation of
  voting systems is far from being neutral; the decisions made on who
  votes, and how, when, and where they do so is inherently coupled with
  the outcome. Underlying those decisions is a nebulous, inconclusively
  answered question: are elections fair, and how can we make them more so.
  
  The passage of the Help America Vote Act---or HAVA--(Robert Nay, 2002),
  which mandated states to update and consolidate public voter
  registration files, and created the US Elections Assistance Commission
  that makes available county level data, innovated the way we use data
  based approaches to answer this question. HAVA offered political
  scientists and statisticians direct access to the voting population's
  voting patterns, political registration, age, geolocation and much more;
  information that up to then was only accessible by sampling through
  surveys. The immense leap here happens because true population data does
  away with the need for sampling techniques that are often biased and
  inaccurate. We can now not only get a complete picture of the data, but
  also link and merge with other sources of information such as US Census
  data on religion, race, education, or income---work that has been
  lucrative for firms such as Catalist or Target Smart. By posing
  Political Scientific questions, and trying to respond with rigorous
  statistics, both disciplines tackle these data to face joint problems
  such as quantifying the quality of voter registration files
  (Ansolabehere \& Hersh, 2010), or linking disparate voter records
  (Ansolabehere \& Hersh, 2017).
  
  \chapter{The State of the Literature}\label{rmd-basics}
  
  In this chapter I will go through the exsting literature on Vote-By-Mail
  (VBM). I will define what Vote-By-Mail, or VBM, is; I will then
  summarize the expectations that researchers have of the effects of VBM
  on turnout, based on existing theories of electoral participation. I
  will continue with a summary of previous quantitative research on the
  effects that VBM and similar policies have had on turnout. I will
  conclude with some more general comments on the available data, and
  literature concerning the most commonly used quantitative methods.
  
  \section{What is VBM?}\label{what-is-vbm}
  
  Gronke (2007, 2008), RMStein (1998)
  
  Vote-By-Mail is a process by which voters receive a ballot delivered by
  mail to their homes. Voters then have a variety of options on how to
  return these ballots, ranging from dropping them off at pre-designated
  locations, to mailing them in, to bringing them to a polling place and
  voting conventionally. This varies across states that have implemented
  VBM. Some common forms of the VBM policy are:
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \emph{Postal Voting}: All voters receive a ballot by mail, which can
    then be returned to a pre-designated location or mailed in to be
    counted. This is the current system in Oregon, is an option in
    Colorado, and is implimented by a number of counties in California,
    Utah, and Montana.
  \item
    \emph{No-Excuse Absentee}: Voters can choose to register as absentee
    voters without giving any reason related to disability, health,
    distance to polling place etc. This is the case in 27 states and the
    District of Columbia.\\
  \item
    \emph{Hybrid or Transitionary Systems}: In hybrid systems, voters
    receive a mail ballot but can choose to disregard it and vote
    conventionaly. This is the case in Colorado. Transitionary systems
    exist in states that have chosen to eventually conduct all elections
    by postal voting, but have given counties an adjustment period during
    which this shift is not mandatory, or mandatory only for certain
    elections. This is the case in California, Utah, and Montana.
  \end{itemize}
