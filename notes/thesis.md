## Thesis

Notes on jobs to be completed over the summer:

* Streamline workflow and consolidate files: public to GitHub, private and notes to Google Docs
* Parse through election books for sources
* Initial wrangling of data--after I find out what it is exactly
* Do the Scholarships and Fellowships things
* GRE in GR
* Go to the beach and stay there for an exuberant amount of time
